This game is all about words. 

In each tile a letter must be placed which creates a word and a score will be added in order to give its value. 

Each letter has a different value and once a word is formed the score for the word will be calculated by adding each value of the letters. 

In the event of a player placing a word where it causes others to think it is not a real or valid word, the word validator checks if the word is valid!

This game allows between 2 - 4 players.
