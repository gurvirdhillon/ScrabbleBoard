# ScrabbleBoard
This file contains a index.html file which contains the scrabble game with features such as drag and drop, music, hint mode, profile creation and many other features.
I have modularised the javascript files according to its use, the "gridNtiles.mjs" is used in the creation of the grid and the tiles that come with it. The alphabet.mjs was used in order to place random letters onto the chosen tiles in the tile rack. The game controller is the main file which is used as an interface to make it more userfriendly to the player of the game allowing them to have unique features such as customising the background, reading the rules on the click of a button and having a zoom in and zoom out feature for the game.


Starts on command:
* npm install
